## Build & Development
### Setup

Fork and clone the repo. 
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/RiahiKarim/QRadarMentorUI.git
```

`cd` into it and install npm dependencies:

```shell
$ cd QRadarMentorUI
$ npm install
```

Install grunt-cli:

```shell
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Install bower dependencies:

```shell
$ bower install
```
(Choose angular#1.5.5)

This next step will be the only one you will use from now-on:

```shell
$ grunt serve
```

This will rebuild the site in dev mode (scripts are not minified etc.) and will start the application. You can access the site on `localhost:9000`.

####Note : [Backend API](https://github.com/RiahiKarim/QRadarMentor.API)
The commands above will run locally only the front-end part of QRadar Mentor and consume a backend API deployed in the IBM Cloud Bluemix.
To build and start your own Backend API follow the instructons in this [repo](https://github.com/RiahiKarim/QRadarMentor.API), then you need to update the backEnd.url constant in [modules.module.js](https://github.com/RiahiKarim/QRadarMentorUI/blob/master/app/modules/app.module.js) to target the entry point of your backend API.
```javascript
...
}).constant("backEnd", {
   "url": "Your Backend API endpoint"
})
...
```
