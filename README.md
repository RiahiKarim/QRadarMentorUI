## Build & Development
### Setup

Fork and clone the repo. 
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/RiahiKarim/QRadarMentorUI.git
```

`cd` into it and install npm dependencies:

```shell
$ cd QRadarMentorUI
$ npm install
```

Install grunt-cli:

```shell
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Install bower dependencies:

```shell
$ bower install
```
(Choose angular#1.5.5)

This next step will be the only one you will use from now-on:

```shell
$ grunt serve
```

This will rebuild the site in dev mode (scripts are not minified etc.) and will start the application. You can access the site on `localhost:9000`.
